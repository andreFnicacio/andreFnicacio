### André Nicácio - Backend Developer, Python RPA, NodeJS, AWS 🎒

I am a back-end developer with a passion for automation and artificial intelligence. Let me share my journey with you:

- 🤖 **Udna (2020-2022):** At Udna, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project called AI Ursula. I delved into machine learning and developed an AI system that could detect potential diseases based on people's routines and eating habits.

- 💼 **Sofie (2022-2023):** Joining Sofie was the next step in my career. Here, I focused on developing endpoints and microservices for financial business models like Pagarme and PagSeguro. Additionally, I created an analytical bot from scratch using Node.js and Python. This bot seamlessly integrated with the company's operations and administration, providing quick solutions and scaling user interactions.

- 🚀 **Lifepet (2023):** I embarked on a new challenge at Lifepet, where I played a key role in developing the PetPremium health plan. I utilized microservices and integrated Python for analysis and automation with Node.js to create robust functionalities.

- 🔧 **Agenus (2023-Present):** At Agenus, I am focused on implementing advanced automation with artificial intelligence and robots. I develop efficient chatbots for client interaction, robust APIs for service management, and scalable microservice architectures, leveraging Python, NodeJS, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize processes and enhance system efficiency.

I also have experience working with various AWS services, such as Lambda, Gateway, S3, EC2, IAM, and DynamoDB. ☁️
